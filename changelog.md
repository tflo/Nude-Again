#### 1.1.0 (2022-09-10)
- Disabled also re-equipping if in combat lockdown (instead of only unequipping)
  - This should minimize the risk of incomplete re-equipping
- _New feature_: If a modifier key is down while clicking the button (or launching the command/macro), then all slots will be unequipped.
  - This can be useful in situations where you have to strip everything, in order to reduce damage output (e.g. old instances where the boss must not be one-shot for an achievement).
- toc: update for 9.2.7

#### 1.0.0 (2022-08-13)
- Duplicate item links are now re-equipped correctly (e.g. dual-wielding weapons with same ID and same enchant ID)
- Removed some legacy stuff from code and toc
- Everything up to date for 9.2.7
